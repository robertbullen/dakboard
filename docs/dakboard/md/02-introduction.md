- Provide a calendar that functions for everyone
    - We had outgrown the kids' classroom monthly calendar
    - Consolidate our four family member's calendars but still identify to whom events pertain
- Publish some of the hundreds of photos that are otherwise rarely viewed after capture
    - Make it easy for wife to contribute
- Show the weather so we can all dress appropriately and determine whether the kids can walk to school
- Intelligently control the screen
    - Keep the screen off during nighttime hours
    - Automatically turn on the screen only while being viewed to save energy
