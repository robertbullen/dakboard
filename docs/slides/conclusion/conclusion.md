## Future Plans and Ideas

- Try pulsing instead of blinking LEDs&mdash;PWM using hardware pins or software emulation
- Create a second screen named "Bluety and the Hofish" that accommodates landscape-oriented photos and loop between it and "Purply Derply"
- Experiment with CSS Grid for arranging dashboard tiles (as opposed to absolute positioning)
- Define systemd template unit files for startup/shutdown
