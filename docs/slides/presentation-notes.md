## Software

### Python

- creating packages
- static type analysis using typing and mypy
    - capabilities are still maturing
- Advanced programming techniques:
    - multiple inheritence via mixins
    - immutable named tuples via dataclasses
    - custom iterable instances
    - dynamic module loading
- `gpiozero` package
- `transitions` state machine
    - self-documenting

### Design & CSS

- Clean and modern, but natural and organic
- maximize data density while minimizing clutter
    - compare with provided templates
- font selection
    - compare cap heights, x-height, counters, and bowl
- color palette selection services
- CSS variables and calculations
- infinitely scalable design
