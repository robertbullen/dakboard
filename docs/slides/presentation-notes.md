# Presentation

## Hardware

- electronic circuits
    - LED brightness variability

### Python

- creating packages
- static type analysis using typing and mypy
    - capabilities are still maturing
- Advanced programming techniques:
    - multiple inheritence via mixins
    - immutable named tuples via dataclasses
    - custom iterable instances
    - dynamic module loading
- `gpiozero` package
- `transitions` state machine
    - self-documenting

### Design & CSS
